 * 63. Unique Paths II
 *
 * Medium
 *
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
 *
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to
 * reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
 *
 * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 *
 * An obstacle and space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
 *
 * There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Constraints:
 * m == obstacleGrid.length
 * n == obstacleGrid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
